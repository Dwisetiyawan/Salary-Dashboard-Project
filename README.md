# Data Jobs Salary Dashboard #

## Project Background ##
In January 2025, the World Economic Forum released the Future of Jobs Report 2025, showing transformations in demanded skills and the job market in 2025. Based on the report, some jobs in Technology, Data, and Renewable Energy are projected to be growing fast. These are 15 fastest growing jobs in 2025-2030, and 3 of them are data related jobs.

This finding, drives me to do a further research about data jobs to gain more information related to data jobs salary and count of job posted, based on country where the jobs were opened, type of the job, and platforms where it was posted. I created a dashboard to show how is the trend in data jobs and gain insights for my consideration in my future career. This research used real data job information in 2023.
